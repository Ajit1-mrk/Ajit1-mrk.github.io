						<li>In today's 1st half of the session, we discussed trigger scenario-based questions.</li>
						<li>Start a new topic <b>Visualforce</b>:- Visualforce is a framework that allows developers to build sophisticated, custom user interfaces that can be hosted natively on the Lightning platform.</li>
						<li>We discussed the use of visualforce pages in tabs,custom buttons, and links.</li>
						<li>We discussed the controller and the types of controller.
							 <ul>
								<li><b>Standard controller </b>- Standard controllers fetches data and provide to the views such as page, list, dialog or forms</li>
								<li><b>Standard list controller</b> - The standard list controller allows you to create Visualforce pages that can display or act on a set of records</li>
								<li><b>Custom controller</b> - Use custom controllers when you want your Visualforce page to run entirely in system mode, which does not enforce the permissions and field-level security of the current user.</li>	
								<li><b>Controller extension</b> - Controller extension is the third type of controller which extends the behaviour of standard controller. Controller extensions are used to integrate visualforce page with native user interface. Controller extension can not override the functions of standard buttons.</li></ul></li>
						
						<li>I learnt about the 'Wrapper class' and why it is used.</li>

						<li>created static and non-static methods where static methods don't need an instance to execute whereas non-static methods need an instance to execute.</li>
						<li>Learnt about constructors which contain the same class and method name and they are of three types: default, parameterise, and non-parameterise.</li>
						<li>I learned more in detail about OOPS(Class, Object, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polyporphism) concepts and how to implement them.</li>
						<li>Use of the this keyword : The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name.</li>
						<li>Use of the super keyword : The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass constructor. The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.</li>
						<li>Use of the extends keyword: indicates that a class is inherited from another class.</li>
						<li>Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.</li>

						<li>Today I learnt about reports. I learned how to write tabular reports, summary reports, matrix reports, and joined reports in reports. In the report, we can do grouping by column, grouping by rows, or grouping by both, depending on the type of report. I also came to know about the bucket field. With the use of this, we can do grouping. There are some standard report types, and we can create custom reports.</li>
